# Generated Translation Files
# The core feature of Translyte is to generate these on the fly.
# You should only commit your base language file(s) and let the server
# create the others when they are needed.

# This pattern ignores all files in /translations...
/translations/*

# ...but re-includes your base language file.
# Update this line if your base language is not 'en'.
!/translations/en.json

# If you use a nested structure like /en/main.json, comment out the
# two lines above and use something like this instead:
# !/translations/en/
# !/translations/en/main.json
